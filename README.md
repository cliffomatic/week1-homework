Homework
Probably took about 7 hrs to do this work.
Had real trouble adding that extra library for text formatting.  Had coworker show me.

Stuff that I did in this build:
- Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
- Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
- Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.
- Add a UITextField with a background image.
- Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.
- Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable
- Optional: The like button should toggle the "liked" state.
- Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears.
- Optional: Tapping on the photo should show a view controller with a full-screen photo.

Stuff I wonâ€™t get to:
- Optional: Tapping on the tabs (requests, messages, etc) should show other view controllers.
- Optional: Implement the notifications page programatically without using Interface Builder. Don't use table views, just statically layout the views assuming no scrolling.
- Optional: The left and right navigation buttons should be real buttons. In other words, when you tap on them, they should have a highlight state. The buttons don't do anything when you tap on them.
